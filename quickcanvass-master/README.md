COS 333 Project
Spring 2017: Making political canvassing easier

How do I add a page?
Put your mypage.html in qcapp/html
Put any new styles or pics on qcapp/static(/images)
Add your url to qcapp/urls.py
Add the definition of that url to qcapp/views.py
Add random python utilities to qcapp/utils.py

How do I change something else?
It's probably in the quickcanvass directory.  Probably settings.py.
