                <p>QuickCanvass is a tool for Princeton students who are organizing campaigns for student government or constitutional amendments. </p>
                <p>We can help you...</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Learn which constituants are near your geographical location for canvassing on the go.</li>
                  <li>Learn which students are actually part of your election - no more knocking on Junior's doors when running for freshman council.</li>
                  <li>Keep track of which students already support you, which don't, and which can be purswaded via the data your team collects</li>
                  <li>Preserve this data across multiple campaigns in multiple years</li>
                  <li>Collaborate with your volunteers by giving them scripts and questions to ask the people they canvass</li>
                  <li>Ensures that you and your volunteers don't knock the same area twice (unless you want to)</li>
