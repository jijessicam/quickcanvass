            <h5 class = "less1">Give them your 8 digit campaign code (see the number underneath the title-about of your campaign in your <a href='/managerdash/{{netid}}'> Manager Dashboard</a>), and tell them to enter it on their <a href='/volunteerdash/{{netid}}'>Volunteer for Campaigns page</a>.</h5>

            <h3 class= "less">How do I make major changes to my survey?</h3>
            <h5 class = "less1">On your <a href='/managerdash/{{netid}}'>Manager Dashboard</a> page, click the blue "Start a New Survey" button.  This will download your data, clear survey responses, and allow you to choose new survey questions.</h5>

          <li>
            <h3 class= "less">How do I tell if my change is minor or major?</h3>
            <h5 class = "less1">If it's a typo or changing the script, it's minor.  If you're fundamentally changing a survey question, it's probably major.  A major change is one that would require canvassing students again.</h5>

            </h5> <h5 class = "less1"> To record data on any of these students, click the "Canvass" button on the right hand side of the table.  This will show you a screen with the script made by the owner of the campaign, as well as any questions that the owner wanted you to ask the student.  Once you've talked to the student, record their answers and then hit Submit (or Cancel if they weren't home).</h5></li>

            <h3 class= "less">Should I be signed up as a manager or a volunteer?</h3>
            <h5 class = "less1">If you want to be able to direct the campaign or organize volunteers, sign up as a manager.  Usually, this will be either the candidate or the actual campaign manager for the candidate.  If you're here to knock on some doors for your friend, you're a volunteer.  Managers are able to join other campaigns and knock on doors for their campaign.</h5>
